# ∞ Infinite Resume

A transcendent multi-layered digital experience exploring the metaphysical nature of data's infinity. This interactive resume establishes mastery in AI strategy through philosophical depth and technical excellence.

## 🌌 Overview

The Infinite Resume is not just a portfolio—it's a journey through five dimensions of professional identity:

1. **Layer 0: The Gateway** - Where data transcends dimension
2. **Layer 1: Narrative Architecture** - Data stories in superposition
3. **Layer 2: Philosophical Framework** - The metaphysical nature of information
4. **Layer 3: Technical Showcase** - Manifestation of technical mastery
5. **Layer 4: Psychological Hook** - Where mind meets machine

## 🚀 Features

- **Advanced 3D Visualizations**: Mathematical concepts brought to life (Möbius strips, Klein bottles, Hopf fibrations)
- **Interactive Philosophy**: Explore Gödel's incompleteness, Buddhist impermanence, and quantum superposition
- **Live Code Editor**: Demonstrate technical skills in real-time
- **Flow State Tracking**: Neuroaesthetic principles create peak engagement
- **Sacred Geometry**: Metatron's Cube, Flower of Life, and other transcendent patterns

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js, React Three Fiber
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Data Viz**: D3.js
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## 🧠 Philosophy

> "Data is ultimately unmanageable because each datum contains infinite dimensions within dimensions."

This resume explores the intersection of:
- Mathematical infinity and data structures
- Eastern philosophy and information theory
- Quantum mechanics and career superposition
- Neuroaesthetics and user engagement

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Fibonacci Sequences**: Spacing and sizing follow the golden ratio
- **Quantum Aesthetics**: Superposition of states until observed
- **Infinite Depth**: Each interaction reveals new dimensions
- **Flow States**: Designed to create peak psychological engagement

## 📱 Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
